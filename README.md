Sophisticated LaTeX Thesis Template
===================================

Abstract
--------

During their studies most students will be faced to the decision whether
to use LaTeX or an other word processor to write a thesis. Since there are a
number of strong reasons to use the former the next step is to start
writing a LaTeX document.
Sooner or later the student will face issues or implements features that
are very common while writing a thesis in LaTeX. This is why several
instructions and even more tips are available in the Internet about
writing Theses using LaTeX. Altought one can find many minimal examples
and multiple small templates, there is no sophisticated community maintained
template available that demonstrates all useful features.
This project aims to fill this gap by providing a complex but stil easy
to understand template. It should contain all neccessary and nice to have
features someone might need writing a thesis.
So please checkout the template, test it, spread the word, and contribute.
